# ðŸš€ What's On The Way

This is a roadmap of **programs and projects I plan to code**.  
Here youâ€™ll find descriptions, features, and ideas for upcoming projects.

## 2. BTC/ETH seed phrase checker
**Description:**  
A tool to create/load and check cryptocurrency seed phrases (BTC, ETH, LTC) against public blockchain data.

**Note:** The odds of randomly discovering a valid, funded wallet are astronomically lowâ€”comparable to winning the lottery billions of times in a row. This project is for educational and security awareness purposes only. However its still a fun project


**Planned Features:**  
- Generate random seed phrases (BIP39)
- Validate seed phrase format and checksum
- Check wallet balances via public APIs
- Support for multiple cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH), and possibly more
- Option to import custom seed phrases
- Simple, intuitive user interface

## 3. Privacy focused messaging application
**Description:**  
A program that uses Tor (The Onion Router) and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) to securely and privately send communications.

**Planned Features:**  
- Tor network routing for anonymity
- PGP usage to encrypt and decrypt communications
- Self-destructing messages
- Option to import PGP keys
- Option to self encrypt text (to not use in program encryption)
- Group chat support
- Simple, privacy-first UI/CLI
- Open chat rooms that broadcast themselves, anyone can join this

---

## 4. Folder/File Encryption Software
**Description:**  
Custom encryption program to secure files and folders with strong cryptography.  

**Planned Features:**  
- Folder-specific encryption  
- Password-based access (hashing)
- Key generation with some form of randomness (Maybe mouse movements)
- User-friendly CLI or GUI  

---

## 5. Raccoon clipper rewrite
**Description:**  
An improved rewrite of the [Raccoon Clipper](https://github.com/3022-2/raccoon_clipper) (replaces clipboard crypto addresses)

**Planned Features:**  
- Mostly the same features but improved
- Will scan for seed phrases copied to clipboard too
